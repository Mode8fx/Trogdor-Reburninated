# Trogdor: Reburninated
This is an enhanced recreation of the Homestar Runner Flash game, _Trogdor_. It is currently available for PC, Android, Switch, Wii U, Wii, Gamecube, 3DS, Vita, PSP, [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/detail.html?name=trogdorrb), and FunKey.

Homestar Runner is no stranger to [fan ports](https://www.mrphlip.com/ds/pop_tire/) of its [Flash games](https://www.mrphlip.com/ds/secret/), and its impact on Flash media, as well as Internet media as a whole, cannot be overstated. Though the original game is still playable on modern devices through its [HTML5 port](https://old.homestarrunner.com/trogdor-canvas/index.html), this project aims to expand on the original release with new features and multiplatform libraries that allow for porting to a wide variety of systems.

All screenshots are from PC v1.0 (unless otherwise specified) and can be found in the [screenshots](https://github.com/Mode8fx/Trogdor-Reburninated/tree/main/screenshots) folder.

## FAQ
### Is this a port? Remake? Remaster?
A bit of everything, but I'm calling it a "recreation".

It was made by opening the original game in a Flash decompiler and porting its ActionScript code and Flash assets to C++ code by hand. There's no way to automate this as far as I know, so everything was rewritten manually. Additionally, Flash and C++ are two completely separate beasts that handle many things in completely different ways; many things that do not require coding in Flash (like animation frames and screen scaling) need to be recreated as code in C++.

That being said, almost all art and sound assets are ported directly from the original game, just reorganized into sprite sheets, with modifications only being made when necessary.

### Will this be ported to \_\_\_\_\_?
This game was made to be compatible with both SDL 1.2 and SDL2 specifically so it could be ported to many systems. You have my permission to port this wherever you want.

### Legal Stuff
This is an unofficial fan project made without any involvement from anyone who contributed to the original game. Trogdor and Homestar Runner are owned by the Brothers Chaps, Mike and Matt Chapman. The original Flash game was programmed by Jonathan Howe.
